# UNP_PROJECT_POWER_BI_WITH_SUPPLYCHAIN_DATA

The Supply Chain Dashboard, developed in collaboration with UNP using Power BI, provides a comprehensive overview of key supply chain metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making for business optimization. The dashboard tracks Total Revenue, Total Cost, and Total Profit, offering insights into financial performance and cost management. It also analyzes customer demographics, helping to understand purchasing patterns and preferences across different segments.In addition, the dashboard evaluates the performance of Cosmetics, Haircare, and Skincare product categories, identifying top-performing SKUs and areas for improvement. A significant focus is placed on defect rates, particularly in skincare products, highlighting the need for enhanced quality control measures. The analysis also covers supplier performance and lead times, identifying inefficiencies and suggesting improvements for better supply chain reliability. Furthermore, logistics cost optimization is a key area of study, with insights aimed at reducing expenses while maintaining operational efficiency.The findings indicate that while the business is highly profitable, strategic improvements can drive further growth and efficiency. Reducing defect rates in skincare products can enhance customer satisfaction and retention, while optimizing logistics costs can improve profitability. Additionally, enhancing supplier lead times ensures smoother inventory management and demand fulfillment. By focusing on high-performing SKUs and aligning with customer preferences, the business can strengthen its market position and maximize revenue.This project leverages Power BI, SQL, and Excel to process and visualize supply chain data, demonstrating the value of analytics in optimizing supply chain operations. The insights derived from this dashboard provide a roadmap for continuous improvement in quality control, logistics management, and supplier performance, ultimately driving sustainable business growth.
